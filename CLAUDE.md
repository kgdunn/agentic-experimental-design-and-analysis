# CLAUDE.md — Agent Context

## Project Overview

**Factorial** is a monorepo containing the backend API (FastAPI) and frontend (SvelteKit) for a conversational, LLM-assisted web application that helps users design, run, and analyze scientific experiments using Design of Experiments (DOE) methodology.

The actual statistical analysis tools live in a **separate package**: [`process-improve`](https://github.com/kgdunn/process-improve). That package provides PCA, PLS, factorial designs, response surface methodology, control charts, and more. The backend calls those tools via LangGraph agent orchestration (not yet implemented).

For full system architecture (agent tools, knowledge graph schema, deployment), see `docs/architecture/` (split across `overview.md`, `monorepo.md`, `tech-stack.md`, `agent-tools.md`, `knowledge-graph.md`).
For frontend UI/UX spec (pages, components, streaming protocol), see `docs/frontend/specification.md`.
For VPS deployment guide, see `docs/deployment/vps-guide.md`.
Documentation is built with MkDocs and deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Versioning

The version is defined in `backend/pyproject.toml` under `[project] version`. It uses 3-part semver: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `0.3.8`).

**Auto-bump the version with every PR that changes code or configuration:**
- **PATCH** (last position, e.g., 0.3.7 → 0.3.8): bug fixes, CI/workflow changes, docs updates, dependency bumps, small refactors, and other minor changes.
- **MINOR** (middle position, e.g., 0.3.8 → 0.4.0): new features, new modules, significant API additions, or meaningful behavioral changes. Resets PATCH to 0.
- **If unsure** whether a change is major or minor, **ask the user** before bumping.

The PyPI publish workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) automatically detects version changes on push to `main` and publishes to PyPI, then creates a GitHub Release with a `v$VERSION` tag.

## Configuration — `.env.example` is canonical

`.env.example` at the repo root is the **single source of truth** for every environment variable the backend reads. It must stay in sync with `backend/src/app/config.py`: every field on the `Settings` class has a matching entry in `.env.example`, and no variable is documented anywhere else unless it also appears there.

**When a PR touches config, check all three together:**

1. **Add / rename / remove a field in `config.py`** → update `.env.example` in the same commit (new entry, rename, or deletion with a short comment line if the removal is load-bearing).
2. **Update `docs/deployment/vps-guide.md`** (Phase 4.3 and any other place that enumerates env vars) so it does not contradict `.env.example`. The VPS guide should show only the production-specific overrides the operator must change, and explicitly point at `.env.example` as the canonical list — it must never re-declare a variable that no longer exists in `.env.example` (e.g. `ADMIN_EMAILS`, which was removed when admins moved into the `users` table).
3. **Never leave obsolete vars in the docs.** If a variable was removed from `config.py`, grep the repo (`rg '\bVAR_NAME\b' docs/ README.md CLAUDE.md`) and delete every lingering reference — stale env-var docs silently mislead operators.

If you catch a drift between `config.py`, `.env.example`, and the deployment docs while working on an unrelated task, fix it in a small dedicated commit rather than letting it rot.

## Development Conventions

### Backend (Python)

- **Python >= 3.12** — use modern syntax (type unions with `|`, etc.)
- **Line length: 120 characters — hard limit.** Enforced by Ruff (`E501`) in CI and via the repo-level pre-commit hook (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`). Do not add `# noqa: E501`; do not introduce per-file or per-directory overrides for E501. If a line is too long, refactor it (extract helper, shorten identifiers, break up the expression).
- **Linting**: ruff with rules E, W, F, I, N, UP, B, S, T20, SIM
- **Pre-commit check**: before committing, always run **both** `ruff check src/ tests/` **and** `ruff format --check src/ tests/` from `backend/`. CI runs both and will fail if either reports issues. Use `ruff format src/ tests/` to auto-fix formatting. Install the pre-commit hook once with `pre-commit install` at the repo root to get the same checks on every local commit.
- **Imports**: sorted by ruff (isort-compatible), `app` is first-party
- **Async-first**: all database operations use async drivers (asyncpg for PostgreSQL, neo4j async for Neo4j)
- **src layout**: code lives in `backend/src/app/`, imported as `from app.xxx import yyy`
- **Versioned API**: all routes under `/api/v1/` prefix, new versions get `/api/v2/` etc.
- **Dependency injection**: use FastAPI's `Depends()` for database sessions, auth, etc.
- **Lifespan pattern**: startup/shutdown logic in `main.py` async context manager (not deprecated `on_event`)
- **Settings via environment**: `pydantic-settings` reads from `.env` file and env vars. Never hardcode credentials.
- **DB sessions**: `get_db_session()` yields an `AsyncSession`, auto-commits on success, rolls back on exception

### Frontend (SvelteKit)

- **Svelte 5** with runes (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`) — no legacy stores API
- **TypeScript strict** for all `.ts` and `.svelte` files
- **Tailwind CSS 4** for styling — utility classes, no custom CSS unless necessary
- **ECharts** for all visualizations — no D3, no Chart.js
- **SvelteKit adapter-static** — SPA mode, served via nginx in production
- **File-based routing**: pages in `src/routes/`, layouts in `+layout.svelte`
- **API calls**: use `fetch` with `/api` prefix — proxied to backend in dev via Vite config

### Database

- PostgreSQL for structured/relational data (experiments, users, results)
- Neo4j for knowledge graph (entity relationships, domain ontology, RAG)
- Alembic for PostgreSQL schema migrations (runs from `backend/` directory)
- All SQLAlchemy models inherit from `app.db.base.Base`
- **Single initial migration**: the schema lives in one forward-only revision (`backend/alembic/versions/0001_initial_schema.py`). Any future schema change is a **new** Alembic revision that chains on top of it. Do not edit `0001_initial_schema.py` in place. Until the first production release, prefer to extend that initial revision directly rather than accumulating tiny migrations. No transition columns, dual-write shims, or "kept for one release" cruft — break the schema cleanly.

### Incremental database changes (expand / contract)

The production deploy strategy is **blue-green** (two backend containers alongside a shared Postgres; see `docs/deployment/vps-guide.md` Phase 13b). During every cutover, two code versions run against the same database at the same time — the old colour keeps serving live traffic and in-flight SSE streams while the new colour takes over. That constraint makes schema migrations a place where mistakes cause user-visible outages.

The rule: **every migration merged to `main` must be backwards-compatible with the previous code version.** Follow the classic expand/contract split:

- **Expand** (safe during a blue-green deploy):
  - Add a new table.
  - Add a nullable column.
  - Add an index `CONCURRENTLY`.
  - Widen a `VARCHAR` / loosen a check constraint.
  - Backfill a default into new nullable rows.
- **Contract** (NOT safe to ship in the same deploy as the matching expand; must go in a **subsequent** deploy after the expand has rolled out and the old code is gone):
  - Drop a column.
  - Tighten `NULL` → `NOT NULL`.
  - Drop a table.
  - Rename a column (in effect a drop + add).
  - Remove an enum value.

A destructive change paired with the code that depends on it will take down the still-running old colour mid-deploy.

### Agent behaviour on schema-changing PRs

Because this discipline is new and the user is not yet fully comfortable with the blue-green strategy, Claude sessions that touch the database schema MUST actively walk the user through the implications rather than just making the change:

1. **Flag it up front.** The moment a task involves a new Alembic migration, an edit to an existing migration, or a change to a SQLAlchemy model that will require a migration, pause and say so explicitly: "this is a schema change — let's step through expand/contract before I write code".
2. **Classify the change.** For each altered column or table, state whether it is expand-safe or contract-destructive, and why. Use the lists above.
3. **Sequence the rollout.** If the change is contract-destructive, propose splitting it across two PRs / two deploys:
   - PR 1: expand-only (new nullable column / backfill / code writes to both old and new).
   - PR 2: contract (drop the old column) once PR 1 has shipped and no running container is still reading the old shape.
   Call out explicitly which PR this is and what the next one will need to do.
4. **Check in with the user before implementing.** Ask: "does this plan match what you expect, or should we go destructive in one shot because there are no real users yet?" The user's answer governs how the work proceeds.
5. **Keep walking them through it.** Do this on **every** schema-change PR until the user says in chat that they are comfortable with the blue-green strategy and tells Claude to drop the hand-holding. Do not assume comfort because the conversation mentions blue-green; require an explicit "you can skip the walkthrough now".

This is load-bearing: short-circuiting the walkthrough defeats the whole point of having blue-green in the first place.

### Testing

- **Backend**: Set `APP_ENV=testing` to skip database connectivity checks. Tests do NOT require running PostgreSQL or Neo4j.
- **Frontend**: vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E (when added)
- Run backend tests: `make test`

## Authentication

**Dual auth**: JWT Bearer tokens (browser users) + API key (machine-to-machine).

- **JWT**: `python-jose` + `passlib` + `bcrypt`. Short-lived access tokens (30 min) + refresh tokens (7 days).
- **API key**: `X-API-Key` header with HMAC comparison. Retained for service-to-service calls.
- **`require_auth` dependency** (`api/deps.py`): tries JWT first, falls back to API key, returns an `AuthUser` dataclass.
- **User model** (`models/user.py`): email, password_hash, display_name, role_id (FK → roles), is_admin, is_active.
- **User scoping**: `user_id` FK on `conversations` and `experiments` is **NOT NULL**; ownership is checked unconditionally (no service-account bypass). Admin-only routes gate on `is_admin` via `require_admin`.
- **System prompt personalization**: the user's role slug (from the `roles` table, surfaced on `AuthUser.background`) is appended to the agent system prompt.
- **Auth endpoints**: `POST /auth/register`, `POST /auth/login`, `POST /auth/refresh`, `GET /auth/me`.
- **Frontend**: JWT stored in localStorage, injected via `authFetch()` wrapper. Auth guard redirects to `/login`.
- **Testing bypass**: `APP_ENV=testing` returns a synthetic test user; no real auth needed in tests.

### Future auth graduation
- AWS Cognito or Supabase Auth when social login/MFA needed
- Redis for token blacklisting (currently stateless)

## Git & PR Workflow

- **Commit after every micro step** — each logical change (new file, edit, deletion) gets its own commit.
- **Push regularly** — don't accumulate unpushed commits.
- **Open a PR right away** — create a pull request as soon as the branch has its first commit. Don't wait until the work is "done."
- **Always share the PR link** — after creating a pull request, always include the PR URL in your response to the user.
- **Never push lock files.** Claude Code sessions must not stage, commit, or
  push any dependency lock file. Lock-file updates are performed manually by
  the repository owner.

Specifically, do **not** include the following in any commit or PR opened from
a Claude Code session:

- `backend/uv.lock`
- `frontend/package-lock.json`
- `frontend/npm-shrinkwrap.json`
- `frontend/yarn.lock`
- `frontend/pnpm-lock.yaml`
- any equivalent regenerated lock artifact

If a command (e.g. `uv sync`, `npm install`) regenerates a lock file during a
session, leave the file uncommitted. If it has already been staged, unstage it
(`git restore --staged <lockfile>`) before committing. The user will refresh
lock files manually outside of Claude Code sessions.

## Future Architecture (not yet implemented)

### Agent Orchestration
- **LangGraph** for multi-step agent workflows (design experiment -> analyze -> present)
- Currently using raw Anthropic SDK for the agent loop
- **LangSmith or Langfuse** for agent observability/tracing

### Redis
- Deferred for now (commented out in docker-compose.yml)
- Will be added for session state, agent conversation caching, JWT token blacklisting
